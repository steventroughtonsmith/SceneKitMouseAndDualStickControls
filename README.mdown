WHAT IS THIS?
=============

I put this together so that there's an easy place for someone to find first-person-shooter-style mouse-look and Halo-style dual-stick controls to use with SceneKit, Apple's new 3D framework for apps and games. Works with an Xbox 360 Controller using the driver from http://tattiebogle.net/ (that's all I test with). Uses code borrowed from the awesome work Tom Irving did for SceneKraft @ https://github.com/thermogl/SceneKraft/tree/master/SceneKraft.
